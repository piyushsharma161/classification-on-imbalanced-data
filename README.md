# classification-on-imbalanced-data
classification on imbalanced data using Random forest and using imblearn library.


# Need to maximize recall i.e. to reduce false negative (falsely predicted churned customer as negative), so that bank can provide some offers to the customer.
# There is more scope of performance improvement by using more set of hyper parameters
# My focus was on hyper parameter tuning so escaped data exploratory analysis, feature engineering, feature extraction, feature selection steps.	

# best result found with BalancedRandomForestClassifier, both train and test performace is almost same.

# used F2 score for performace as to increase recall score along with fairly good precison score
